## Goals:
### produce a python roguelike engine that can make it easier for me to produce various games
### create a modular system with interchangeable parts.

## Systems that differ:
### create a system that enhances the dialogue experience by giving a wide array of topics but having it condensed enough to be straight forward
### create task based system that progresses and changes world when completed

## Ideas for post games:
### fantasy setting where all characters get quest/tasks, actually improve/change their community
### apocalypse inspired by fallout and other settings
### wildwest where play as a cowboy collecting bounties
### zombie apocalypse
### simlike where a household is played instead
### military game where role switches on death, have to create arms and stuff as citizen while stockpiling for revolution, have to try and help war effort while balancing civilian needs as diplomat, and actually fight as soldier
### sci fi?
### ants/insects
### demons vs angels
### never ending snow survival

## Current Features:
### character management
### stat management (buggy, needs tests)
### pathfinding
### inventory
### barebones combat

## Remaining MVP goals:
### UI
### keybindings
### speech system
### quest/task system
### dungeon generation (unfinished, needs testing)
### crafting/building
### tilesets

## Suggestions:
### actually do the tcod tutorial all the way through, I'm sure it can help
